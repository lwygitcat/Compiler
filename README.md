Implementation of compiler using Antlr

This is a Mini Compiler we developed for my course ECE 573;

I use the tool Antlr to help generate Scanner and Paser for our little language.
Basing on the sematic routines, different actions are taken to generate IR code
I then use the liveness analysis to deploy the register allocation
It is runnable on a 4 register simulator
